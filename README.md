	Working with Git and GitHub has almost made me throw up and cry hysterically on the floor. However, I would also consider this a valuable learning experience.
 
	Initially, problems started to appear from the very beginning when installing Git and setting Local Repository. Command “brew install git” did not seem to work and as a victim of AI progress I’ve searched the answers, but ended up on Reddit browsing the post regarding MacOS and Git installation errors. 

	Afterwards, I faced some other challenges, such as navigating directories, initializing a repository, and handling errors like "fatal: not a git repository." Because despite taking the passing python course with a decent grade I still have no idea how Git and GitHub function. However, through trial and error, I became more comfortable with basic Git commands.

	I attempted to add and commit files in the wrong location, which resulted in constant errors. Locating and understanding the repository was definitely the most difficult challenge so far, because I needed but couldn’t confirm the presence of necessary files.After barely understanding the location commands, another important lesson was understanding the Git workflow: initializing a repository (git init), adding files (git add), committing changes (git commit -m "message"), and pushing them to GitHub.

	The easiest thing so far was only configuration. Setting the username and email.

	I couldn’t manipulate any files until I realized that this happened when the file doesn’t exist or hasn’t been created properly. So, using touch filename and ls helped me confirm file creation before adding it to Git.

	I definitely do not now feel confident using GitHub, but at least I’ve learnt a lot.
